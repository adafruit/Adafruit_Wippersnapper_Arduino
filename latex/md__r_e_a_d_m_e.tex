Adafruit.\+io allows you to monitor, interact with, and share your project\textquotesingle{}s data in minutes.

Adafruit.\+io Wipper\+Snapper is the firmware designed to turn any Wi-\/\+Fi capable board into an Internet-\/of-\/\+Things (IoT) device. No code required!

Wipper\+Snapper works with multiple microcontroller architectures such as ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-\/\+S2, ESP32-\/\+C3, and ATSAMD51.

You will need a {\bfseries{free}} \href{https://io.adafruit.com}{\texttt{ Adafruit IO}} account to use Wipper\+Snapper.

{\bfseries{This software is in beta}} and is actively being developed. Please report bugs via the \href{https://io.adafruit.com/support}{\texttt{ Adafruit IO Support Page}}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Get Started}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}

We support building and locally testing Wipper\+Snapper with the Platform IO IDE for Visual Studio Code. These instructions are subject to modification.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{Platform IO Build Instructions}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Download and install \href{https://code.visualstudio.com}{\texttt{ Microsoft Visual Studio Code}}, Platform\+IO IDE is built on top of it
\item Follow the instructions on \href{https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode}{\texttt{ platformio\textquotesingle{}s website to install the Platform IO IDE extension}}.
\item \href{https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository}{\texttt{ Make a local clone}} of the \href{https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Wippersnapper_Arduino}{\texttt{ Adafruit Wipper\+Snapper Arduino repository}} on your computer.
\item In {\ttfamily platformio.\+ini} file in the root of this repository, find the board you\textquotesingle{}d like to build Wipper\+Snapper for. Change its {\ttfamily upload\+\_\+port} and {\ttfamily monitor\+\_\+port} to match your system.
\item The {\ttfamily platformio.\+ini} file in the root of this repository includes multiple environments to build Wipper\+Snapper for different boards. In the \href{https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable//integration/ide/vscode.html\#platformio-toolbar}{\texttt{ Platform IO toolbar}}, use the Project environment switcher to switch to the board you\textquotesingle{}d like to upload to.
\item Open the {\ttfamily examples/\+Wippersnapper\+\_\+demo/\+Wippersnapper\+\_\+demo.\+ino} file.
\item On the \href{https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable//integration/ide/vscode.html\#platformio-toolbar}{\texttt{ Platform IO toolbar}}, click the build (checkmark) button. If there are no build errors, click the upload (right arrow) button.
\item Wipper\+Snapper should be uploaded to your board. You may use the Platform\+IO Serial Monitor to view Wipper\+Snapper\textquotesingle{}s debug output.
