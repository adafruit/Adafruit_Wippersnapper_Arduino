# `.claude/` — Claude Code-specific configuration

Agent skills are canonical in `.agents/skills/` and shared across all harnesses (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, etc.). This directory contains only Claude Code-specific configuration that cannot be made tool-agnostic.

## Contents (Future use)

- `agents/` — Sub-agent persona definitions with Claude Code-specific frontmatter (`model`, `memory`, `color`, `tools`).
- `agent-memory/` — Persistent agent memory files. Claude Code runtime state, not portable across tools.
